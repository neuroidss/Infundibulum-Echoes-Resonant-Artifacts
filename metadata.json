  "description": "Step through the Infundibulum, a portal to a different reality. This is not a music app; it's an instrument for 'vibecoding'—collaborating with an AI to generate audio-visual experiences that defy the laws of our universe. Your touch, motion, and voice summon alien soundscapes and impossible visuals. Capture these fleeting moments as 'Resonant Artifacts'—memories of a world that shouldn't exist, but does. Welcome to a place of maximum creativity, where nothing is familiar.",
